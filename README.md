Analysis for Nuclear Transfer to Elicit embryonic Transcriptional Reprogramming Paper

Analysis for the Tomikawa et al. (2021) is split into two sections:

1) For the three-strain mouse NT reads were mapped to an merged genome using kallisto. Genome specific differential expression was identified using Sleuth. Example scripts are provided in the Kallisto subfolder

2) For cross species analysis genes were first mapped to the mouse genome using STAR. Unmapped reads were then mapped to Oryx genome using STAR. Example scripts can be found in STAR folder.
